#分组数据

SELECT vend_id,COUNT(*) AS num_prods FROM Products GROUP BY vend_id;
--根据vend_id进行分组统计
--GROUP BY 出现在WHERE子句之后，ORDER BY子句之前

SELECT cust_id,COUNT(*) AS orders FROM Orders GROUP BY cust_id HAVING COUNT(*)>=2;
--WHERE在数据分组之前进行过滤，HAVING在数据分组之后进行过滤

SELECT order_num,COUNT(*) AS items FROM OrderItems GROUP BY order_num HAVING COUNT(*)>=3 ORDER BY items,order_num;

--顺序：SELECT FROM WHERE GROUP BY HAVING ORDER BY

#子查询 SubQuery

SELECT cust_id FROM Orders WHERE order_num IN (Select order_num FROM OrderItems WHERE prod_id ='RGAN01');
SELECT cust_name, cust_contact FROM Customers WHERE cust_id IN(SELECT cust_id FROM Orders WHERE order_num IN (SELECT order_num FROM OrderItems WHERE prod_id = 'RGAN01'));

Group BY Customers.cust_id;
--INNER JOIN 与 COUNT() 函数的联结
